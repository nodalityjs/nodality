Generated per release from the source diff.

## 1.0.214 — 2026-08-03

### Breaking
- Removed the spacing options `arrayMargin`, `arrayPadding`, `arrpad`, `paddings`, `multipad`, `multimargin`, and Text's `padding`. `mar` and `pad` are now the only options that set margin and padding. Migration: `arrayMargin: {sides: ["top","bottom"], value: "10px"}` becomes `mar: [{tb: "10px"}]`.
- Removed the centering methods `toCenter()`, `flexc()`, `toCol()` and `simpleCenter()`, and the options `centerColumn`, `flexCenter` and `simpleCenter`. Use `center`.
- `center` now means the same thing on every component: centre this element's CHILDREN. On Text it previously set auto margins, centring the element itself — that is now `mar: "center"`.
- `center: true` centres both axes. It previously centred one.
- Removed `layout/styler.js` (the `Style` class) along with `Text.style()` and `Link.style()`. Nothing imported it and it was unreachable through the package `exports` map.
- Removed `padRight` from Link's nested image options. Use `pad`.

### Added
- `center: true | "x" | "y"` — defined once on `Animator` and dispatched from `commonMethods`, so every component accepts it. Axis-aware: in a flex column `"y"` is `justify-content` and `"x"` is `align-items`; a row reverses them; a grid uses `justify-items`/`align-items` without being converted to a flexbox.

### Fixed
- `border` no longer sets `padding: 0.25em`. It ran after `pad()` and silently overwrote it, so `{pad: [{a: 40}], border: {...}}` rendered 4px instead of 40px.
- Wrapper's code export emitted `arrpad` under a `pad:` key in one branch and `arrpad:` in another, and interpolated the sides array into a single string (`sides: ["left,top"]`), so exported code lost its margins.
- Bare numbers now apply. The removed array forms assigned values such as `20` directly to `style.paddingTop`, which is invalid CSS the browser discarded; `mar`/`pad` treat a number as pixels. Calls that silently did nothing will now render — check any layout that passed unitless numbers.

### Changed
- `mboth` is deprecated in favour of `mar: "center"`. It still centres, and now logs a deprecation notice via `Animator.deprecatedOption()`. Removed options log the same way rather than failing silently.

## 1.0.213 — 2026-08-03

### Changed
- Internal: added inline documentation comments for existing `set` options (`resmar`, `hover`, `size`, `resprop`, `noTheme`, `theme`, `hide`) in `Animator`. No behavioral change.

## 1.0.212 — 2026-08-02

### Changed
- Added inline documentation comments for existing `link` options: `fixMobileTap`, `nowrap`, `block`, `rounded`, and `new`. No behavioral changes.

## 1.0.207 — 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- `set()` now applies the `borderObj` option directly when given the `{ width, color }` form, instead of silently ignoring it on components without their own handler (e.g. TextField, Picker, Button, Image, Center) or requiring it to be chained separately via `.borderObj(...)`. The shorthand `{ a: "..." }` form is still left to components that implement it themselves.

## 1.0.206 — 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- `commonMethods` in `Animator` now maps `color` → `color`, so `.set({ color: ... })` works consistently across components. Previously `color` was missing while `background` was present, meaning components that style themselves purely through `commonMethods` (e.g. `Picker`) silently ignored a `color` option and did not update text colour.
- Containers that never handled `color` before (`FlexGrid`, `FlexRow`, `Center`, `UList`) now support it instead of silently no-oping.

### Changed
- All other files: comment/header changes only (copyright year), no functional changes.
